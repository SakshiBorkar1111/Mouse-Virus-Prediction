Mouse Virus Infection Prediction


Problem Statement:

This project builds a machine learning model to predict whether a mouse infected with a virus will still be infected after being given doses of two medicines. 

The model classifies:

•	0 → Not Infected

•	1 → Infected

This study can help in analyzing medicine effectiveness and supporting research in treatment planning.
